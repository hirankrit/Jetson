## 🔬 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Left Camera Has Low Coverage?

**It's NOT about lighting. It's about GEOMETRY!** 🎯

#### Geometric Occlusion Explained:

```
Side View (Looking from side):

        📷Left    📷Right
          ↓         ↓
      [60mm baseline]
          │         │
          │         │    🌶️ Pepper Pile
          ↘       ↙      (Height: 9.5cm)
            ╲   ╱         ╱╲
              ╳          ╱  ╲
            ╱   ╲      ╱ Top ╲
          ╱       ╲   ├────────┤
        ╱   LEFT   ╲  │ Middle │ ← Right camera sees this
       │   BLOCKED  │ └────────┘
       └─────────────┘
       Left camera           Right camera
       sees LESS            sees MORE
```

**Key Factors:**

**1. Baseline (60mm) + Close Distance (23cm)**
```
Parallax angle = arctan(60mm / 230mm) = 14.6°

At close range:
- Left camera looks from LEFT at 14.6° angle
- Right camera looks from RIGHT at 14.6° angle
- Each camera sees DIFFERENT parts of the pile!
```

**2. Pile Shape (Asymmetric)**
```
If pile leans/shapes towards right:
→ Right camera sees top + sides ✅
→ Left camera blocked by pile itself ❌
```

**3. Wide-Angle Lens (160° FOV)**
```
Wide FOV + Close range + Occlusion
→ Severe distortion at edges
→ Left camera sees mostly edges (low texture)
→ Right camera sees center (better texture)
```

## 🧪 Proof: It's Geometry, Not Lighting

### Test Results:
```
✅ Added 3x LEDs (Top, Left, Right)
✅ No shadows
✅ Uniform lighting
❌ Left coverage still 9%!

Conclusion: Lighting is NOT the limiting factor.
```

### What WOULD improve Left coverage?

**A. Change Camera Position (not practical)**
```
Option 1: Increase camera height
→ More top-down view → less occlusion
→ But changes working distance

Option 2: Decrease baseline
→ Less parallax → less occlusion
→ But worse depth accuracy (need baseline for depth!)
```

**B. Change Object Configuration (not practical)**
```
Option: Spread out peppers (don't pile them)
→ Each pepper visible to both cameras
→ But defeats purpose (we WANT to sort piled peppers!)
```

**C. Accept Limitation + Design Around It** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
```
✅ Right coverage 45% is GOOD ENOUGH!
✅ Left coverage 9% is expected for piled objects
✅ Overall coverage 27% is ACCEPTABLE

Why it's OK:
1. We use YOLO for (X, Y) detection → doesn't need full coverage
2. We use depth for Z only → ROI-based percentile method
3. Robot picks from top → only needs top surface depth
```

## 📐 Comparison: Pile vs Single Pepper

### Single Pepper (Week 1 Results):
```
Coverage: 40-70% (both cameras see it well)
Left/Right: More balanced
Depth accuracy: ±0.5cm
```

### Pepper Pile (This Test):
```
Coverage: 27% overall
Left: 9% (occlusion!)
Right: 45% (good)
Depth accuracy: ±0.3mm (10%ile repeatability)
```

### Key Insight:
**Piled objects → Occlusion → Asymmetric coverage** (EXPECTED!)

## 🎯 Recommended Solution

### Accept Current Setup + Optimize Algorithm

**Instead of fighting geometry, work WITH it:**

#### 1. Use Right Camera as Primary for Depth
```python
# Right camera has better coverage (45%)
# Use right camera view for:
#   - Texture matching
#   - Coverage estimation
#   - Quality check
```

#### 2. YOLO Detection on Combined/Left Image
```python
# YOLO doesn't need depth
# Detects (X, Y) bounding box on 2D image
# Works fine with Left camera view
```

#### 3. ROI-Based Depth with Percentile
```python
# From YOLO bbox:
bbox = (x, y, w, h)
roi_depth = depth_map[y:y+h, x:x+w]
valid = roi_depth[roi_depth > 0]

# Use percentile (already proven stable!)
pepper_depth = np.percentile(valid, 10)  # ±0.3mm repeatability ✅

# Don't care about coverage %
# Only care about: "Do we have ENOUGH valid pixels?"
if len(valid) > 0.1 * w * h:  # 10% coverage minimum
    # Good enough!
    pick_position = (x + w/2, y + h/2, pepper_depth)
```

#### 4. Multi-View Approach (Future)
```python
# For difficult cases:
# Option 1: Camera on BOTH sides
#   → Pick from side with better coverage

# Option 2: Multiple captures with rotation
#   → Rotate object 45° → capture again
```

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### For Pepper Sorting System:

**Single Peppers (Primary use case):**
```
✅ Coverage: 40-70%
✅ Both cameras see well
✅ Depth accuracy: ±0.5cm
✅ Perfect for sorting!
```

**Piled Peppers (Input pile):**
```
⚠️ Coverage: 27% (left: 9%, right: 45%)
✅ 10%ile depth: ±0.3mm repeatability (excellent!)
✅ Percentile method: robust
✅ YOLO bbox: works on left image
✅ Good enough for picking from pile!
```

**Strategy:**
```
1. Input Pile (low coverage, but OK)
   → YOLO detects top peppers
   → Pick using 10%ile depth
   → Robot removes top layer

2. As pile gets smaller
   → Coverage improves (less occlusion)
   → Bottom peppers more visible

3. Single peppers on sorting area
   → High coverage (40-70%)
   → Accurate depth
   → Reliable sorting
```

## 🔧 Hardware Recommendations

### Current Setup: ✅ KEEP AS IS

**Lighting:**
- ✅ 3x LEDs (Top, Left, Right) - Good!
- ✅ No shadows - Perfect!
- ✅ Uniform illumination - Great!
- 💡 **Keep this setup!**

**Camera:**
- ✅ Stereo baseline 60mm - Good for 20-50cm range
- ✅ Wide FOV 160° - Covers workspace
- ⚠️ Left/Right asymmetry - Expected, acceptable
- 💡 **No change needed**

### Future Improvements (Optional):

**If sorting accuracy critical:**

1. **Adjustable Camera Height**
   ```
   - Mount on linear rail
   - Adjust height for:
     * Pile (higher → more top-down)
     * Single peppers (lower → better detail)
   ```

2. **Top-Down Camera (Supplementary)**
   ```
   - Add monocular camera directly above
   - For top-view YOLO detection
   - Stereo camera for depth only
   ```

3. **Polarized Filters**
   ```
   - Reduce specular reflection
   - Especially for shiny peppers
   - May improve texture matching
   ```

## 💡 Key Insights for Teaching

### Lesson Learned: Stereo Vision Limitations

**1. Coverage Asymmetry is Normal**
```
❌ Common misconception: "Both cameras should see equally"
✅ Reality: Occlusion → asymmetric coverage (expected!)
```

**2. Lighting vs Geometry**
```
❌ Don't assume: "Poor coverage = bad lighting"
✅ Analyze first: Is it lighting or geometry?
```

**3. System Design Philosophy**
```
❌ Don't fight physics: "Perfect coverage everywhere!"
✅ Design around limitations: "Good enough coverage where needed"
```

**4. Practical Metrics**
```
❌ Don't obsess: "Must have 90% coverage!"
✅ Ask instead: "Is it good enough for the task?"

For pepper sorting:
- 27% coverage → ✅ YOLO detection works
- 10%ile ±0.3mm → ✅ Picking works
- System is READY!
```
