# Week 1: Stereo Vision System
## Pepper Sorting Robot Project

**Platform**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano + IMX219 Stereo Camera
**Date**: October 21-27, 2025
**Phase**: Vision System Foundation (Week 1 of 12)

---

## Week 1 Overview 🎯

### Objectives
✅ Setup stereo camera on Jetson Orin Nano
✅ Calibrate for accurate depth measurement
✅ Validate with real peppers
✅ Prepare for Week 2 (dataset collection)

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Stereo calibration: **Baseline 60.57mm** (matches spec!)
- ✅ Depth accuracy: **±0.2cm @ 32cm** (pattern), **±0.5cm** (peppers)
- ✅ Critical insight: **Edge vs. Center limitation discovered**
- ✅ Solutions developed: **Adaptive percentile methods**

---

## Hardware Setup 🔧

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Computer** | Jetson Orin Nano 8GB |
| **Camera** | IMX219-83 Stereo (8MP, 60mm baseline, 160° FOV) |
| **Height** | 320mm from ground (top-down view) |
| **Lighting** | LED left-front, angled 45°, 10cm distance |
| **Pattern** | Asymmetric Circles 5×6 (33 circles, 18mm spacing) |

**Why Asymmetric Circles?**
- ✅ Robust to uneven lighting (better than checkerboard)
- ✅ Sub-pixel accuracy (circle centroids)
- ✅ Works well with wide-angle lenses (160° FOV)

---

## Calibration Process 📐

### Data Collection
- **Images**: 40 pairs (exceeded 30 minimum)
- **Variety**: Multiple angles (0-45°), distances (25-50cm)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time focus, lighting, exposure checks

### Focus Optimization
```
Before: Random focus → inconsistent results
After:  Left=176.5, Right=171.0, Diff=6.0 ✅
Result: Sharp images, reliable pattern detection
```

### Tool Used
`capture_calibration.py` with real-time monitoring:
- Focus metrics (Left, Right, Difference)
- Lighting quality (Brightness, Contrast, Exposure)
- Status indicators (🟢 Green / 🟡 Yellow / 🔴 Red)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Challenge: Spacing Confusion!

### The Problem
Spent hours getting wrong baseline (436mm instead of 60mm!)

### The Confusion
```
❌ WRONG: "spacing = 18mm" = physical distance between circles
✅ RIGHT: "spacing = 18mm" = y-axis step in calculation

Actual nearest distance = √(18² + 18²) = 25.46mm
```

### How to Measure Correctly ✅
1. **Recommended**: Measure horizontal Row 0: Col 0 → Col 1
   → 36mm / 2 = **18mm** ✅
2. **Alternative**: Measure vertical Row 0 → Row 1
   → **18mm** directly ✅

**Lesson**: Always validate printed pattern dimensions!

---

## Calibration Results ✅

| Metric | Value | Status | Comment |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Left Camera RMS** | 0.22 px | ✅ Excellent | <0.3 px is good |
| **Right Camera RMS** | 0.20 px | ✅ Excellent | <0.3 px is good |
| **Stereo RMS** | 50.79 px | ⚠️ High | Normal for 160° FOV! |
| **Baseline** | 60.57 mm | ✅ Correct | Matches 60mm spec |
| **Images Used** | 40 pairs | ✅ Good | >30 recommended |

**Key Insight**: High Stereo RMS ≠ Bad Calibration!
- Wide-angle lens (160° FOV) → barrel distortion → high RMS
- Individual cameras excellent → calibration valid ✅
- Real-world testing confirms accuracy ✅

---

## Depth Measurement: Pattern Board 📏

**Test Setup**: Asymmetric circles pattern @ 32cm

### Results
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Mean depth** | 31.9 cm | ✅ Excellent |
| **Error** | -0.1 cm (-0.3%) | ✅ Within ±2cm target |
| **Std deviation** | 0.4 mm | ✅ Outstanding! |
| **Coverage** | 80-90% | ✅ High texture |
| **Repeatability** | 15 tests, ±0.4mm | ✅ Consistent |

**Improvement**: Fixed `numDisparities` 160→512
→ 99.7% error reduction! 🎉

---

## Depth Measurement: Real Peppers 🌶️

### Test 1: Single Pepper @ 32cm ✅
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Mean depth | 31.5-32.5 cm | ✅ Good |
| Error | ±0.5 cm | ✅ Within target |
| Coverage | 40-70% | ✅ Sufficient |
| Repeatability | Consistent | ✅ Reliable |

### Test 2: Pepper Pile (5cm height) ⚠️
| Metric | Observed | Expected |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Actual height | 5.0 cm | - |
| Measured diff | 0.5 cm | 5.0 cm ❌ |

**Discovery**: Only 10% of height detected! Why? 🤔

## 🔬 Critical Discovery: Edge Bias

### The Physics of Stereo Vision

```
        Left Camera    Right Camera
             👁️             👁️
             │             │
         ┌───┴───┬───────┴───┐
         │  Edge │   Edge    │ ← Both see clearly ✅
         │   ╭───┴─────╮     │
         │  │  Center  │     │ ← Different angles ❌
         │   ╰─────────╯     │
         └───────────────────┘
```

**Why Edges Work**: Same viewing angle, high contrast
**Why Centers Fail**: Occlusion, curved surface, different angles

**This is NOT a bug!** It's expected physics! 🔍

---

## Edge Bias: Experimental Evidence

### Pepper Pile (5cm height)
```
Side View:           Depth Map:
  Top    ─────       ← Center, no depth
  Middle ═════       ← Some edges
  Bottom █████       ← Full coverage ✅

Result: Measures mostly bottom edges
→ Top center has no valid depth
→ Height 5cm → measured 0.5cm
```

### Impact on Sorting
- **Single Pepper** ✅ Works great! (40-70% coverage)
- **Pepper Pile** ⚠️ Edge bias → needs adaptive methods

**Key Insight**: Small objects = mostly edges = good! ✅

---

## Solutions Developed 💡

### Solution 1: Foreground Detection
```python
# Separate foreground from background
foreground = (depth > min_depth) & (depth < max_depth)
# Clean noise with morphological operations
cleaned = morphology_operations(foreground)
# Extract ROI depth
pepper_depth = np.percentile(roi_depth, 10)
```

### Solution 2: Adaptive Percentile ⭐ **Recommended**
```python
# Adapt based on coverage
if coverage < 0.25:
    percentile = 5   # Low coverage → closest point
else:
    percentile = 10  # Good coverage → slight margin

pepper_depth = np.percentile(valid_depth, percentile)
```

**Why Adaptive**: Robust for curved objects, all scenarios!

---

## Recommended System Design 🎯

### YOLO + ROI Depth + Adaptive Percentile

```python
# Step 1: YOLO detects pepper
bbox = yolo_detect(image)  # (x, y, w, h)
x_center, y_center = x + w/2, y + h/2

# Step 2: Extract ROI depth
roi_depth = depth_map[y:y+h, x:x+w]
valid = roi_depth[roi_depth > 0]
coverage = len(valid) / (w * h)

# Step 3: Adaptive percentile
percentile = 5 if coverage < 0.25 else 10
pepper_depth = np.percentile(valid, percentile)

# Step 4: 3D position for robot
position_3d = (x_center, y_center, pepper_depth)
robot_arm.pick(position_3d)
```

**Why This Works**: X,Y from YOLO ✅ | Z from adaptive depth ✅

## Lessons Learned (1/2) 🎓

### Technical Lessons
1. **Start simple, add complexity later**
   - GStreamer > Isaac ROS for initial testing

2. **Validate everything with real measurements**
   - Print pattern → measure with ruler
   - Calibration RMS ≠ enough → test depth!

3. **Understand sensor limitations**
   - Stereo: edge excellent, center poor
   - Not a bug → it's physics!
   - Design system to compensate

4. **Parameters matter!**
   - numDisparities 160→512 = 99.7% improvement
   - Calculate requirements first

---

## Lessons Learned (2/2) 🎓

### Project Management
5. **Documentation while you work**
   - Future self will thank you!

6. **Test early, test often**
   - Found limitations in Week 1 (not Week 10!)

7. **Create reusable tools**
   - 3 testing tools for different use cases

### Research Lessons
8. **Literature isn't enough**
   - Papers don't mention edge bias much
   - Hands-on testing reveals real issues

9. **"Good enough" is enough**
   - ±0.5cm sufficient for sorting
   - Don't over-optimize!
